# 🎨 Collaborative Canvas Board Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my summer internship project! This project showcases the development of a collaborative canvas board using the Express stack and Socket.IO, enabling real-time drawing interactions without user authentication.

## 🚀 Introduction

During this internship, I developed a collaborative canvas board application. This project is built using MongoDB, Express.js, Socket.IO, and React. The main focus was to enable real-time drawing interactions between multiple users without the need for authentication.

## 🗓️ Project Timeline

### Week 1: Initial Setup and Socket Integration

**10th may 2024 - 14th may 2024**

1. **Project Structure Setup:**
   - Initialized the project using MongoDB, Express.js, and Socket.IO.
   - Established a basic project structure with necessary dependencies.

2. **Express Server Implementation:**
   - Developed a basic Express server to manage socket connections.
   - Configured the server to handle static files and set up routes.

3. **Socket.IO Integration:**
   - Integrated Socket.IO for real-time communication.
   - Implemented basic socket event handlers for connection and disconnection.

### Week 2: Canvas Component and Real-Time Drawing

**17th may 2024 - 23rd may 2024**

1. **Canvas Component Creation:**
   - Built a canvas component using React.
   - Enabled users to draw on the canvas using mouse events.

2. **Socket Event Handlers:**
   - Established socket event listeners and emitters to broadcast drawing data.
   - Ensured real-time updates by sending and receiving drawing data between clients.

3. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Tested the real-time drawing functionality to ensure smooth interactions.
   - Debugged issues related to latency and data consistency.

## 📚 Technologies Used

- **MongoDB:** For data storage.
- **Express.js:** As the backend framework.
- **Socket.IO:** For real-time communication.
- **React:** To create the canvas component.
